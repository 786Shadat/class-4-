        <div><p>Oh Abu Dharr! Take advantage of five things before five things seize you;
         Your youth before Your old age, your health before your sickness,
          Your wealth before your poverty
         your spare time before you busy and your life before you death.</p></div>
         <div class="a"><p>Oh Abu Dharr! Don't look at the smallness of the sin but look
             at the one you disobeyed. </p> </div>
             <div class="b"><p>Oh Abu Dharr! This world is the prison of 
                the believer and the paradise of the unbeliever...</p></div>
